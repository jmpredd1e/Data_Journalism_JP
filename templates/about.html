        <h1> About My Project - Jaiden Preddie</h1><br>
        <p>
            One thing that has plauged America since the beginning of its founding is the underlying racial tension.<br>
            In recent times these tensions have been most clearly seen in policy brutatility. <br>
            So for my data anaylsis I took a look at the races of people who were arrested for RESISTING ARREST.

        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            My first predicament was trying to configure a way for the entire information <br>
            document to be spread across a data set. So, since I was talking about New <br>
            York and it was winter I used an svg of the different boroughs and used <br>
            different brightnesses of blue as an indicator. The different brightnesses of <br>
            blue were representative of the black vs non black ratio in each of the <br>
            boroughs. In this prototype I had to think of ways to increase user activity <br>
            so I added a couple of buttons and a way to go into the more separated drop <br>
            down menu similar to how we did in the life expectancy lab.<br>
        </p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='IMG_5895.JPG') }}" alt="Page TWO" style="transform: rotate(270deg); width: 500px; margin-left: 80px;">
        <p>
            I figured out how I was going to get to the micro page and I knew how I <br>
            formated my reformat data file and using that I thought about using a bar <br>
            graph and although the amount of data is not as much as I was hoping it still <br>
            had a good amount of data that I could use to draw a conclusion. <br>
        </p> <br> 
        <h3> FEEDBACK </h3> <br>
        <p>
            “Make the map different colors” - Julien<br>
            “The bar graph is very interesting and definitely is a good way to structure your data” - Kyle <br>
            “Remove Jersey if you are not taking data from it” - Divya <br>
            “Have a legend to explain what the colors are” - Divya <br>

        </p>
        <h3> MY CHANGES </h3> <br>
        <p>
            The button was changed around a lot and the data I used had to be moved to <br>
            accommodate my micropages. In addition I was forced to shift my map over and I <br>
            removed/cut out a lot of unnecessary details on the map that made it a little <br>
            bit confusing for user interaction. <br>
